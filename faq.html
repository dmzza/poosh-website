          <h2>Why can't I have more than one habit?</h2>
          <p>Poosh isn't a todo list. Keeping a journal should help you make a meaningful change in life, but making too many changes at once is why most people fail. If you need to loose weight, learning to eat better and exercise at the same time could be a mistake. Try something simple like jogging 10 minutes every day, and continue eating the way you always have. It will be easier to change your diet once you have a well established jogging habit. Set your goals low, and gradually increase them over time.</p>
          <h2>I need to <br>quit smoking<br>quit snacking<br>quit soda<br>quit television. <br>Why won't Poosh let me do that?</h2>
          <p>If you need to give up something you enjoy, you're approaching it the wrong way. Poosh is designed for doing things you enjoy more often. Instead of watching less television, do more cycling and keep enjoying television. Maybe one day you will enjoy cycling more than TV. You don't need to fight yourself to form better habits.</p>
          <h2>I want to eat healthier. Why won't Poosh let me do that?</h2>
          <p>Right now Poosh is only designed for fitness habits. </p>
          <h2>I have an obscure fitness habit that isn't available.</h2><p>David wants to know about it. Email him directly: <a href="mailto:david@poosh.com">david@poosh.com</a></p>
          <p>If you just want to go to the gym more often, pick an activity that you do at the gym as your habit.</p>
          <h2>Can I schedule a reminder for my habit?</h2><p>Not at this time. </p>
          <h2>What if I don't want to take a selfie?</h2><p>Poosh only allows use of the front-facing camera. What you do with it is up to you. Currently, a photo is required for every journal entry.</p>
          <h2>What if I forget to use Poosh on a day that I did my habit?</h2><p>You can't make journal entries for the past. Try to use Poosh every day. If you miss your habit one day, just swipe to the left to mark it not done. If you forget to make a journal entry, you will break your streak.</p>
          <h2>How can I share my selfie?</h2><p>Use the three dots on the right side of the note. You can share a screenshot of your whole journal entry.</p>
          <h2>Can I sync/transfer my journal to another device?</h2><p>Not at this time. If you loose your phone or reinstall the app, you will loose your journal. However, your selfies are stored in your camera roll and in an album called Poosh, so they should sync to Photo Stream if you have enabled that in iCloud.</p>
          <h2>I'm confused...</h2><p>David is the developer/designer and he enjoys criticism. </p>
          <p><a href="mailto:david@poosh.com">david@poosh.com</a></p>
          <p>Tell him everything that you hate about Poosh. Making great apps requires a lot of feedback and criticism. If you're in the Bay Area, David will gladly buy you a coffee to talk about it in person.</p>
